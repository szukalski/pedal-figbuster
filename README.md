This is the Figbuster, built in respect for the venerable Fig at PedalPCB, with guidance from music6000.

This repository contains:

* A gerber file to produce the PCB. (RAW)
* A gerber file to produce the PCB with a location specified for the production number if using JLCPCB. (JCLPCB)
* A schematic.

There is no support supplied or guaranteed for the PCB. I have built it and it works, YMMV.

## Build notes

* MPSA13 is a NPN Darlington pair. If you don't have one, you could make your own from two NPN BJT, or try a single BJT (untested)
